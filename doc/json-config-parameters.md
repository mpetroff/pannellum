# JSON Configuration File Options



## General options


### `type` (string)

This specifies the panorama type. Can be `equirectangular`, `cubemap`, or
`multires`. Defaults to `equirectangular`.


### `title` (string)

If set, the value is displayed as the panorama's title. If no title is desired,
don't set this parameter.


### `author` (string)

If set, the value is displayed as the panorama's author. If no author is
desired, don't set this parameter.


### `strings` (dictionary)

Allows user-facing strings to be changed / translated.
See `defaultConfig.strings` definition in `pannellum.js` for more details.


### `basePath` (string)

This specifies a base path to load the images from.


### `autoLoad` (boolean)

When set to `true`, the panorama will automatically load. When `false`, the
user needs to click on the load button to load the panorama. Defaults to
`false`.


### `autoRotate` (number)

Setting this parameter causes the panorama to automatically rotate when loaded.
The value specifies the rotation speed in degrees per second. Positive is
counter-clockwise, and negative is clockwise.


### `autoRotateInactivityDelay` (number)

Sets the delay, in milliseconds, to start automatically rotating the panorama
after user activity ceases. This parameter only has an effect if the
`autoRotate` parameter is set.


### `autoRotateStopDelay` (number)

Sets the delay, in milliseconds, to stop automatically rotating the panorama
after it is loaded. This parameter only has an effect if the `autoRotate`
parameter is set.


### `fallback` (string)

If set, the value is used as a URL for a fallback viewer in case Pannellum is
not supported by the user's device. The user will be given the option to click
a link and visit this URL if Pannellum fails to work.


### `orientationOnByDefault` (boolean)

If set to `true`, device orientation control will be used when the panorama is
loaded, if the device supports it. If false, device orientation control needs
to be activated by pressing a button. Defaults to `false`.


### `showZoomCtrl` (boolean)

If set to `false`, the zoom controls will not be displayed. Defaults to `true`.


### `keyboardZoom` (boolean)

If set to `false`, zooming with keyboard will be disabled. Defaults to `true`.


### `mouseZoom` (boolean or string)

If set to `false`, zooming with mouse wheel will be disabled. Defaults to `true`.
Can also be set to `fullscreenonly`, in which case it is only enabled when the
viewer is fullscreen.


### `draggable` (boolean)

If set to `false`, mouse and touch dragging is disabled. Defaults to `true`.


### `disableKeyboardCtrl` (boolean)

If set to `true`, keyboard controls are disabled. Defaults to `false`.


### `showFullscreenCtrl` (boolean)

If set to `false`, the fullscreen control will not be displayed. Defaults to
`true`. The fullscreen button will only be displayed if the browser supports
the fullscreen API.


### `showControls` (boolean)

If set to `false`, no controls are displayed. Defaults to `true`.


### `touchPanSpeedCoeffFactor` (number)

Adjusts panning speed from touch inputs. Defaults to `1`.


### `yaw` (number)

Sets the panorama's starting yaw position in degrees. Defaults to `0`.


### `pitch` (number)

Sets the panorama's starting pitch position in degrees. Defaults to `0`.


### `hfov` (number)

Sets the panorama's starting horizontal field of view in degrees. Defaults to
`100`.


### `minYaw` and `maxYaw` (number)

Sets the minimum / maximum yaw the viewer edge can be at, in degrees.
Defaults to `-180` / `180`, i.e. no limit.


### `minPitch` and `maxPitch` (number)

Sets the minimum / maximum pitch the viewer edge can be at, in degrees.
Defaults to `undefined`, so the viewer center can reach `-90` / `90`.


### `minHfov` and `maxHfov` (number)

Sets the minimum / maximum horizontal field of view, in degrees, that the
viewer can be set to. Defaults to `50` / `120`. Unless the `multiResMinHfov`
parameter is set to `true`, the `minHfov` parameter is ignored for
`multires` panoramas.


### `multiResMinHfov` (boolean)

When set to `false`, the `minHfov` parameter is ignored for `multires`
panoramas; an automatically calculated minimum horizontal field of view is used
instead. Defaults to `false`.


### `compass` (boolean)

If `true`, a compass is displayed. Normally defaults to `false`; defaults to
`true` if heading information is present in Photo Sphere XMP metadata.


### `northOffset` (number)

Set the offset, in degrees, of the center of the panorama from North. As this
affects the compass, it only has an effect if `compass` is set to `true`.


### `preview` (string)

Specifies a URL for a preview image to display before the panorama is loaded.


### `previewTitle` (string)

Specifies the title to be displayed while the load button is displayed.


### `previewAuthor` (string)

Specifies the author to be displayed while the load button is displayed.


### `horizonPitch` and `horizonRoll` (number)

Specifies pitch / roll of image horizon, in degrees (for correcting
non-leveled panoramas).


### `animationTimingFunction` (function) [API only]

This specifies a timing function to be used for animating movements such as
when the `lookAt` method is called. The default timing function is
`easeInOutQuad`. If a custom function is specified, it should take a number
[0, 1] as its only argument and return a number [0, 1].


### `escapeHTML` (boolean)

When true, HTML is escaped from configuration strings to help mitigate possible
DOM XSS attacks. This is always `true` when using the standalone viewer since
the configuration is provided via the URL; it defaults to `false` but can be
set to `true` when using the API.


### `crossOrigin` (string)

This specifies the type of CORS request used and can be set to either
`anonymous` or `use-credentials`. Defaults to `anonymous`.


### `hotSpots` (object)

This specifies a dictionary of hot spots that can be links to other scenes,
information, or external links. Each array element has the following properties.


#### `pitch` (number)

Specifies the pitch portion of the hot spot's location, in degrees.


#### `yaw` (number)

Specifies the yaw portion of the hot spot's location, in degrees.


#### `type` (string)

Specifies the type of the hot spot. Can be `scene` for scene links or `info`
for information hot spots. A tour configuration file is required for `scene`
hot spots.

#### `text` (string)

This specifies the text that is displayed when the user hovers over the hot
spot.

#### `URL` (string)

If specified for an `info` hot spot, the hot spot links to the specified URL.
Not applicable for `scene` hot spots.

#### `attributes` (dict)

Specifies URL's link attributes. If not set, the `target` attribute is set to
`_blank`, to open link in new tab to avoid opening in viewer frame / page.

#### `sceneId` (string)

Specifies the ID of the scene to link to for `scene` hot spots. Not applicable
for `info` hot spots.

#### `targetPitch` (number)

Specifies the pitch of the target scene, in degrees. Can also be set to `same`,
which uses the current pitch of the current scene as the initial pitch of the
target scene.

#### `targetYaw` (number)

Specifies the yaw of the target scene, in degrees. Can also be set to `same` or
`sameAzimuth`. These settings use the current yaw of the current scene as the
initial yaw of the target scene; `same` uses the current yaw directly, while
`sameAzimuth` takes into account the `northOffset` values of both scenes to
maintain the same direction with regard to north.

#### `targetHfov` (number)

Specifies the HFOV of the target scene, in degrees. Can also be set to `same`,
which uses the current HFOV of the current scene as the initial HFOV of the
target scene.

#### `id`

Specifies hot spot ID, for use with API's `removeHotSpot` function.

#### `cssClass` (string)

If specified, string is used as the CSS class for the hot spot instead of the
default CSS classes.

#### `createTooltipFunc` (function) and `createTooltipArgs` (object)

If `createTooltipFunc` is specified, this function is used to create the hot
spot tooltip DOM instead of the default function. The contents of
`createTooltipArgs` are passed to the function as arguments.

#### `clickHandlerFunc` (function) and `clickHandlerArgs` (object)

If `clickHandlerFunc` is specified, this function is added as an event handler
for the hot spot's `click` event. The event object and the contents of
`clickHandlerArgs` are passed to the function as arguments.

### `hotSpotDebug` (boolean)

When `true`, the mouse pointer's pitch and yaw are logged to the console when
the mouse button is clicked. Defaults to `false`.

### `sceneFadeDuration` (number)

Specifies the fade duration, in milliseconds, when transitioning between
scenes. Not defined by default. Only applicable for tours. Only works with
WebGL renderer.

### `capturedKeyNumbers` (array)

Specifies the key numbers that are captured in key events. Defaults to the
standard keys that are used by the viewer.

### `backgroundColor` ([number, number, number])

Specifies an array containing RGB values [0, 1] that sets the background color
for areas where no image data is available. Defaults to `[0, 0, 0]` (black).
For partial `equirectangular` panoramas this applies to areas past the edges of
the defined rectangle. For `multires` and `cubemap` (including fallback) panoramas
this applies to areas corresponding to missing tiles or faces.

### `avoidShowingBackground` (boolean)

If set to `true`, prevent displaying out-of-range areas of a partial panorama
by constraining the yaw and the field-of-view. Even at the corners and edges
of the canvas only areas actually belonging to the image
(i.e., within [`minYaw`, `maxYaw`] and [`minPitch`, `maxPitch`]) are shown,
thus setting the `backgroundColor` option is not needed if this option is set.
Defaults to `false`.


## `equirectangular` specific options

### `panorama` (string)

Sets the URL to the equirectangular panorama image. This is relative to
`basePath` if it is set, else it is relative to the location of
`pannellum.htm`. An absolute URL can also be used.

### `haov` (number)

Sets the panorama's horizontal angle of view, in degrees. Defaults to `360`.
This is used if the equirectangular image does not cover a full 360 degrees in
the horizontal.

### `vaov` (number)

Sets the panorama's vertical angle of view, in degrees. Defaults to `180`. This
is used if the equirectangular image does not cover a full 180 degrees in the
vertical.

### `vOffset` (number)

Sets the vertical offset of the center of the equirectangular image from the
horizon, in degrees. Defaults to `0`. This is used if `vaov` is less than `180`
and the equirectangular image is not cropped symmetrically.

### `ignoreGPanoXMP` (boolean)

If set to `true`, any embedded Photo Sphere XMP data will be ignored; else,
said data will override any existing settings. Defaults to `false`.



## `cubemap` specific options

### `cubeMap`

This is an array of URLs for the six cube faces in the order front, right,
back, left, up, down. These are relative to `basePath` if it is set, else they
are relative to the location of `pannellum.htm`. Absolute URLs can also be
used. Partial cubemap images may be specified by giving `null` instead of a URL.


## `multires` specific options

### `multiRes`

This contains information about the multiresolution panorama in sub-keys.


#### `basePath` (string)

This is the base path of the URLs for the multiresolution tiles. It is relative
to the regular `basePath` option if it is defined, else it is relative to the
location of `pannellum.htm`. An absolute URL can also be used.


#### `path` (string)

This is a format string for the location of the multiresolution tiles, relative
to `multiRes.basePath`, which is relative to `basePath`. Format parameters are
`%l` for the zoom level, `%s` for the cube face, `%x` for the x index, and
`%y` for the y index. For each tile, `.extension` is appended.


#### `fallbackPath` (string)

This is a format string for the location of the fallback tiles for the CSS 3D
transform-based renderer if the WebGL renderer is not supported, relative
to `multiRes.basePath`, which is relative to `basePath`. The only format
parameter is `%s`, for the cube face. For each face, `.extension` is appended.


#### `extension` (string)

Specifies the tiles' file extension. Do not include the `.`.


#### `tileResolution` (number)

This specifies the size in pixels of each image tile.


#### `maxLevel` (number)

This specifies the maximum zoom level.


#### `cubeResolution` (number)

This specifies the size in pixels of the full resolution cube faces the image
tiles were created from.



## Dynamic content specific options

Currently, only equirectangular dynamic content is supported.

### `dynamic` (boolean)

The panorama source is considered dynamic when this is set to `true`. Defaults
to `false`. This should be set to `true` for video.



## Additional information for tour configuration files

A tour configuration file contains two top level properties, `default` and
`scenes`. The `default` property contains options that are used for each scene,
but options specified for individual scenes override these options. The
`default` property is required to have a `firstScene` property that contains
the scene ID for the first scene to be displayed. The `scenes` property
contains a dictionary of scenes, specified by scene IDs. The values assigned to
these IDs are specific to each scene.
