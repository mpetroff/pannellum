# Pannellum

## About

Pannellum is a lightweight, free, and open source panorama viewer for the web. Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and WebGL, it is plug-in free. It can be deployed easily as a single file, just 13kB gzipped, and then embedded into pages as an `<iframe>`. A configuration utility is included to generate the required code for embedding.

## How to use
1. Upload `build/pannellum.htm` and a full equirectangular panorama to a web server.
    * Due to browser security restrictions, a web server must be used locally as well. With Python 2, one can use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, and with Python 3, one can use `python -m http.server`, but any other web server will work as well.
2. Use the included multi-resolution generator (`utils/multires/generate.py`) or configuration tool (`utils/config/configuration.htm`).
3. Insert the generated `<iframe>` code into a page.

## Examples

Examples using both the minified version and the version in the `src` directory are included in the `examples` directory.

## Browser Compatibility

Since Pannellum is built with emerging web standards, it requires a modern browser to function.

## Building
The `utils` folder contains the required build tools, with the exception of Python 3.2+ and Java installations. To build a minified version of Pannellum, run either `build.sh` or `build.bat` depending on your platform.
